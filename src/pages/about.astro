        Tolbert’s Restaurant and Chili Parlor in Grapevine, Texas, stands as a
        testament to Frank X. Tolbert's legacy in Texas folklore and cuisine.
        Frank, a larger-than-life journalist and historian born in 1912,
        co-founded the renowned Terlingua Chili Cookoff in 1967, celebrating
        Texan heritage. The Tolbert family's commitment to preserving Frank's
        passion for chili continues through their involvement in the restaurant,
        ensuring authenticity and excellence in every dish. The first Tolbert’s
        Restaurant opened in Dallas in 1976, and after Frank’s passing in 1984,
        his family expanded the restaurant to Grapevine in 2006. Combining
        traditional and modern elements, Tolbert’s offers a rich Texan culinary
        experience, complete with live music, and remains a beloved cultural
        landmark.
