The story I'm about to share is for those who feel lost or discouraged, enduring an injury that's invisible to others and sometimes even misunderstood.

In late July 2023, I experienced a wrist blowout. It was a Sunday, and I had been deeply engrossed in making meticulous edits to drum machine MIDI for my album. After finishing, I couldn't quite remember if my hands felt overworked, but I then shifted to gaming, embracing my "Sunday funday" with no obligations. After gaming for another three hours, my hands began to tire; I felt fatigued and discomfort setting in. I logged off, but it was too late — my tendons had given way.

Unbeknownst to me the foundation for the wrist injury had started a few weeks earlier. I had intensified my weightlifting routine, perhaps too zealously. I recall a moment of particular strain as I pushed for one more bicep curl, inspired by Arnold Schwarzenegger's resilience. This ambition caused spinal compression which eventually created a degenerative disk in my C5-C6 vertebrae setting the foundation for my wrist issues.

Despite the clear signals from my body to rest, I persisted. The following day, as a software developer, I continued my usual activities and even attempted to strengthen my wrist with a 25-pound weight, thinking it would alleviate the tendonitis. This decision only dug me deeper into trouble. During a yoga session, while in the plank pose, I felt a significant give in my right wrist, a moment I pinpoint to the origin of a ganglion cyst that developed later.

I worked excessively long, ignoring the necessity for rest, driven by a wish for a time machine. Eventually, I scheduled an appointment with an orthopedic hand specialist, opting to pay out-of-pocket for expert advice. This decision spiraled into a larger narrative of navigating the healthcare system, a story for another time.

The doctor offered little help, and I continued working until, in October, I urgently requested time off from work, fearing I wouldn't survive without it. This break was a turning point, allowing me to rest fully for the first time and discover Talon, the speech control software that became my lifeline. I dedicated two weeks to mastering computer use via voice control, as my hands were in too much pain for any physical task.

As I continued to work through the pain, I managed to schedule an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Upon reviewing the results, the hand specialist I was seeing seemed baffled and offered no real assistance — it was as if he hadn't even looked at the report.

Determined to find answers, I embarked on a journey of self-advocacy and thorough research. Navigating the complexities of the healthcare system, I secured occupational therapy for my hand and eventually consulted a second doctor for another opinion on my MRI results.

The turning point came with the occupational therapist, who examined my MRI report and identified intriguing findings that aligned with my symptoms. It had been over seven months of enduring not only physical pain but also significant mental and emotional turmoil. She pinpointed a ganglion cyst in the report, located precisely where my chronic pain was most intense.

A visit to another hand surgeon provided clarity; he showed me the exact location of the ganglion cyst on the MRI, confirming the source of my chronic pain, which seemed to be in my radiocarpal joint, or something to that effect.

This ordeal taught me an invaluable lesson: if you're in pain or discomfort, it's crucial to stop and rest rather than pushing through, as doing so only worsens your condition. Of course, this advice is easier said than done, especially when financial stability and lack of a support network are concerns. In hindsight, I wish I had prioritized my health over my job from the beginning.

About a week after confirming the diagnosis of the ganglion cyst, I've been able to concentrate on strengthening and healing, not just the affected area but also my arms, shoulders, and neck. This focus has brought significant improvement and relief.

I share this story in the hope that it reaches others suffering from repetitive stress injuries. While I've omitted many details of my treatment journey, I believe it's crucial to discuss the early struggle with tendinitis. Initially, relief was elusive; I resorted to warm baths and anti-inflammatories, but the pain was almost unbearable, underscoring the importance of rest and proper care from the outset.

In addition to occupational therapy, stretching became a source of relief whenever possible. Looking back, I realized I had allowed my condition to worsen to the point where stretching became a necessity, not just a relief. The chronic use of a mouse and keyboard had inflicted significant damage.

I also suffered from a cervical neck issue, which compounded my misery. Although I'm still navigating this challenge, I've made considerable progress. Thanks to targeted exercises from my occupational therapist, focused specifically on the areas of concern, I've been able to gradually increase the strength training weights. Reflecting on this, I understand that early intervention and ceasing the aggravating activities could have spared me much of this ordeal.

This narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of repetitive stress injuries, which stem from excessive use of the mouse and keyboard, inadequate rest, and pushing too hard during recovery, leading to conditions like the ganglion cyst. However, this story harbors an optimistic undertone. Trust me, this journey has spurred significant personal growth. I've had to rely on untapped skills and attributes to find new ways to engage and entertain myself, granting me a fresh perspective and a deeper appreciation for life's blessings.

As I continue on my path to recovery, I'm grateful for the lessons learned and the progress made. It's a long road ahead, but I'm optimistic. A heartfelt shoutout to the open-source community and Talon speech software — your innovations have been instrumental in my journey. Peace out.
